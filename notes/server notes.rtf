\f0\fs24 \cf0 SSH connection to TU:\
first connect with VPN cisco to\
"vpn.tuwien.ac.at", with\
"e1228563@student.tuwien.ac.at" (and password)\
then connect through an SSH client (ssh on mac) with\
"pryab@picasso.ifs.tuwien.ac.at" and "qeBpE7Pg8HC8zw7h"\
\
- cd ..\
- ls\
- mkdir\
- rmdir\
- stat <filename>\
- pip3 list\
NOTE there is pip and pip3, there python and python3 (python 2 is default!!!)\
\
- in the pryab folder you have access to everything, above it only read access\
- in pryab there is a script that can be run by ./ns.sh to list if the gpus are used or not (pls dont use gpu if its used currently) (nvidia-smi does the same)\
- /data2/datasets/downbeat/beatles/audio/feat_cache_boeck for example has beat features already (as .npy files) the audio files were cleaned away\
\
- iTerm2 is a cooler terminal for mac with syntax highlighting and stuff (already installed)\
\
- "sync_up.sh" script in the "misc" folder is used for rsync to nicely upload files\

\

\f1\b Useful Commands:
\f0\b0 \
\
- nohup.out python3 <script_name> will start the script as "no hang up" and will not terminate if ssh is closed\
	additionally the output will be saved in "nohup.out" file\
- you can monitor the elapsed time with the ./ns.sh script\
- kill a running task with kill -9 <process_id>. Look up process id with ./ns.sh\
- tail -f nohup.out to monitor output in real time (in folder where script was executed)\
	OR tail -f /proc/<process_id>/fd/* NOTE: tail -f /proc/<process_id>/fd/1 seems to be what we need!!!\
	OR watch -n 1 tail -n 20 nohup.out (where -n 1 is every 1 second and -n 20 is last 20 lines)\
